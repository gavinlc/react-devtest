# React Devtest

## Brief

We’d like you to build a website based on ​these wireframes​ that consumes data from the ​TV Maze API​. The
first layout should use the “​Schedule​” API, and each of the Episodes should link to a “​Shows​” layout.

### API URL

TV Maze https://www.tvmaze.com/api
Schedule https://www.tvmaze.com/api#schedule
Shows https://www.tvmaze.com/api#shows

### Make sure your work checks all the points below - it’s what we’ll be looking out for:

- The layout should be based on the provided wireframes, however the look, feel and any interactivity is up to you - don’t be afraid to get creative!
- Work should be submitted as a Git repository.
- The site should be built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and as far as styling is concerned: SCSS, Pre/Post CSS, CSS Modules, and CSS-in-JS are all encouraged.
- The site should be built using responsive techniques to behave well on a variety of devices.
- The site should function as a single ​page application.
- We encourage the use of a framework - our preference is React, and Next.js

### Taking things further

If you have the time, here are some suggestions to enhance the app:

- The use of a build tool
- Responsive images
- Tests (Unit and/or end-to-end)
- Pagination
- Performance optimisation

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
